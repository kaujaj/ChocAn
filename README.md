Project for COMP370. Application for a fitness company called chocan
This was a class project in which the group was asked to create an application for a fitness company called ChocAn by following the SDLC. 
This is a basic management application where staff can log in to the terminal and perform a bunch of tasks such as registering members, tracking schedles etc.
The database used is MySQL and was running on local server.
